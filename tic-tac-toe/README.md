## How to Play

2. The game board will be displayed as a 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns clicking on the empty squares to place their marks (X or O).
4. The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win!
5. If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
6. To play again, simply refresh the page.
